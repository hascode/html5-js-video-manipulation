# Video Manipulations using HTML 5 and JavaScript #

An example on how to apply graphic effects to a video using the HTML5 and Javascript.

## Demos ##

Please take a look at the [demo pages] but these might be slow. In addition please be sure to use Chrome when trying the demos.

## Quick Setup ##

There are restrictions to access the canvas data when you're loading the *index.html* from a local place.

If you've got python installed, simply download the files, change to the directory and run 

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 

Afterwards you're able to load the demo in your browser at *http://localhost:8000/*
